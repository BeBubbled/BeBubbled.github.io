# Overview Life-long Learning (LLL)

LLL also called <u>**Continuous Learning/Never ending Learning/Incremental Learning**</u>

Note:

* Knowledge Retention
  
  * how to teach NN to **remember the knowledge** while maintain the capability of learning others
  
  * but not intransigence
  
  * e.g.
    
    * QA system, dataset: bAbi corpus
    
    * 20 category questions
    
    * way to  train models:
      
      1. multi-task training (could regard it as the upper bound of the life-long learning)
         
         train multi model for each category
         
         you'll get 20 models and need a classifier
      
      2. train 1 models for random mixed QA set
      
      3. life-long
         
         ```pseudocode
         for one_category_set in all_categories:
             train model & one_category_set
         end
         return model
         ```

* Knowledge Transfer
  
  * background
    
    1. we use multi task learning to get multi expert for different task. Now we trying to know if it is possible to increase the expert's performance when learning unrelated domain?
       * e.g. two experts, expert A focuses on ocr Handwritten Mathematical Expression (HME) image without salt noise (dataset from denoised picture) while expert B focuses on ocr blurred/unclear HME image. Can we merge A and B, so then when we feed the B 's datasets to model, we can also increase A's performance?
    2. multi experts would bring additional <u>storage/disk</u> cost
  
  * difference between life-long and transfer learning

Bayes Point of View:
$$
\begin{array}{ll}
\log( p(\theta \mid \mathcal{D}))&=log(\dfrac{p(\mathcal{D} \mid \theta)* p(\theta)}{p(\mathcal{D})})\\
\log p(\theta \mid \mathcal{D})&=\log p(\mathcal{D} \mid \theta)+\log p(\theta)-\log p(\mathcal{D})\\
\log p(\theta \mid \mathcal{D}_{1})&=\log p(\mathcal{D}_{1} \mid \theta)+\log p(\theta)-\log p(\mathcal{D}_{1})\\
\log p(\theta|D_{1})&\propto \log p(\mathcal{D}_{1} \mid \theta)+\log p(\theta)\\
\end{array}\\
$$
now considering that $\textcolor{Red}{\text{after task 1}}$ we have received new task $T_{2}$
$$
\begin{array}{ll}
\log( p(\theta |D_{1},D_{2}))&=log(\dfrac{p(D_{1},D_{2}\mid \theta)* p(\theta)}{p(D_{2}|D_{1})})\\
\log p(\theta| D_{1},D_{2})&=\log (p(D_{1},D_{2} \mid \theta))+\log p(\theta|D_{1})-\log p(D_{2}|D_{1})\\
\log p(\theta| D_{1},D_{2})&=\log (p(D_{1}|\theta)p(D_{2}|\theta))+\log p(\theta|D_{1})-\log p(D_{2}|D_{1})\\
\log p(\theta| D_{1},D_{2})&=\log p(D_{2}|\theta)+\log p(\theta|D_{1})-\log p(D_{2}|D_{1})\\
\end{array}\\
$$

All the information about task A must therefore have been absorbed into the posterior distribution $p(\theta|D_{A)}$.

Based on [A practical bayesian framework for backpropagation networks](https://authors.library.caltech.edu/13793/1/MACnc92b.pdf) work, we use Gaussian distribution with mean equals to $\theta ^{*}_{A}$ to simulate the posterior distribution. Diagonal precision : Diagonal of the Fisher information matrix F.

Fisher information matrix F 

($\color{red}{\text{Actually haven't fully understanded}}$)

"the covariance of the gradient of the model’s log likelihood function with respect to points sampled from the model’s distribution"

Usage: 

1. estimate the variance of MLE

2. ![img](Literature Comments Notes.assets/28c4c679b6758707ed779c066d0e8e3a_1440w-9912047.jpg)
   
   e.g. estimate the curvance of the log likehood's  top point
   
   the higher, the more information you could get

3. 

$$
\begin{aligned}
\overline{\mathcal{F}} &=E_{Q_{x y}}\left[\nabla \log p(x, y \mid \theta) \nabla \log p(x, y \mid \theta)^{\top}\right] \\
&=E_{Q x}\left[E_{Q_{y}}\left[\nabla \log p(y \mid x, \theta) \nabla \log p(y \mid x, \theta)^{\top}\right]\right] \\
&=\frac{1}{N} \sum_{n}\left[\nabla \log p\left(y_{n} \mid x_{n}, \theta\right) \nabla \log p\left(y_{n} \mid x_{n}, \theta\right)^{\top}\right]
\end{aligned}
$$

Lost Function:
$$
\mathcal{L}(\theta)=\mathcal{L}_{B}(\theta)+\sum_{i} \frac{\lambda}{2} F_{i}\left(\theta_{i}-\theta_{A, i}^{*}\right)^{2}\\
$$

$\theta^{*}_{A,i}$ parameter learned from task A
